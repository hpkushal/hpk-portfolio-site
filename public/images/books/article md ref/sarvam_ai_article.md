# Sarvam AI: India's Most Important Bet on Artificial Intelligence

When I first heard about Sarvam AI, I was intrigued by the straightforwardness of its ambition. Not "build a great product." Not "disrupt a market." But something far more consequential: build India's full-stack sovereign AI platform, from the ground up, for a population of 1.4 billion people who speak dozens of languages, live across wildly different socioeconomic contexts, and have for too long been treated as an afterthought by the global AI industry. The more I dug into what Sarvam is doing, the more I became convinced that this is one of the most important technology stories coming out of India right now.

## Who Built This and Why It Matters

Sarvam AI was founded in July 2023 by Vivek Raghavan and Pratyush Kumar, both of whom were previously associated with AI4Bharat at IIT Madras. That origin story matters. These are not founders who stumbled into the Indian language problem. They spent years in academic and research settings understanding exactly how underserved Indian languages are in global AI systems, and they decided to do something about it at a commercial scale.

The company is headquartered in Bengaluru and develops large language models and multimodal AI systems with a focus on Indian languages and region-specific use cases. Within months of launching, Sarvam announced a combined seed and Series A funding round of approximately $41 million in December 2023, led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, with participation from Peak XV Partners and Khosla Ventures. That kind of early-stage confidence from top-tier global investors tells you how seriously the world is starting to take the Indian AI opportunity.

## The Core Problem Sarvam Is Solving

Here is the uncomfortable truth about global AI: most of the large language models we use every day were built on data that skews heavily toward English and Western languages. When an AI model has seen billions of tokens of English text and only a fraction of that in Hindi, Tamil, or Bengali, the quality of its understanding across those Indian languages is fundamentally limited. It is not just a translation problem. It is a comprehension problem, a cultural nuance problem, a problem of the AI simply not knowing India.

Many of the world's most widely used LLMs have traditionally been trained on the languages and cultures of the western world, which means they lack a deeper understanding of India's unique nuance. India has 22 officially recognized languages and hundreds of dialects. Hundreds of millions of people will never primarily communicate in English. For them, the AI revolution was, until very recently, happening in a language they do not fully speak.

Sarvam decided to fix this not by patching existing Western models but by building natively, from scratch, for India.

## What Sarvam Has Actually Built

What strikes me about Sarvam is that it is not just a research lab sitting on promising papers. It has shipped real products across several dimensions.

### Foundational Models at Scale

On February 18, 2026, Sarvam announced the release of two foundational models: Sarvam-30B, a 30-billion parameter model based on a mixture-of-experts design, and Sarvam-105B, a 105-billion parameter model activating approximately 9 billion parameters per token, with a 128,000-token context window, positioned for complex reasoning and enterprise applications. These are not small, boutique models. These are serious, competitive architectures built to go up against global players on benchmarks that matter.

### Indus: India's Own AI Chat App

On February 20, 2026, Sarvam launched its Indus chat app for web and mobile users, entering a fast-growing market dominated by global players including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. The app serves as an interface for the Sarvam-105B model and allows users to type or speak their queries and receive responses in both text and audio. The fact that this app supports Indian languages natively, not as an afterthought, is exactly what distinguishes it from the competition. I find it genuinely exciting that India now has a homegrown AI assistant that understands you when you speak in Hindi, Tamil, or Bengali without needing to mentally translate your thoughts into English first.

### Sarvam-Translate: Bridging 22 Languages

Sarvam built Sarvam-Translate, an open-weights model that translates text across all 22 officially recognized Indian languages, with the ability to handle diverse formats, contexts, and styles including Markdown, HTML, scientific notation, and code. This is critical infrastructure. Think about what it means for a government portal, a healthcare app, or a financial services platform to be able to communicate accurately across every major Indian language. The translation API has served over 100,000 translation requests in the last week alone, covering everything from internal tools to consumer-facing interfaces.

### Saaras V3 and Voice-First AI

Sarvam has developed a speech model referred to as Saaras V3, which supports multiple Indian languages. This focus on voice is not accidental. Voice is how a huge portion of India actually interacts with technology. A grandmother in a rural village is not typing queries into a search bar. She is speaking. Building AI that listens and responds in her language is the only way to make the AI revolution genuinely inclusive.

### Sarvam Vision and Document Understanding

The company has also introduced a vision-language model known as Sarvam Vision, intended for document understanding and optical character recognition in Indian scripts. India has an enormous amount of documentation in regional scripts that remain essentially invisible to global AI systems. Sarvam Vision begins to change that.

### Sarvam Kaze: AI Wearable for India

Perhaps the most forward-looking product in their pipeline is something I find genuinely fascinating. Sarvam Kaze is an indigenous AI-powered wearable glass that listens, understands, and captures what users see the world through their eyes in real time, supporting more than 10 Indian languages and enabling voice-based interaction and potentially real-time translation. The company plans to launch the device in May 2026. An AI wearable built for India, in India, supporting Indian languages. That is a product category statement as much as it is a hardware announcement.

## India's Sovereign AI Infrastructure

The dimension of Sarvam's story that I think deserves the most attention is the sovereignty angle. In a world where AI is becoming core national infrastructure, depending entirely on foreign models built on foreign servers governed by foreign policy frameworks is a genuine risk for any nation.

Sarvam AI has been selected to build India's first homegrown sovereign large language model under the government's IndiaAI Mission, which has a budget of approximately 10,370 crore rupees. The government chose Sarvam after a rigorous selection process involving 67 applicants. The startup received access to 4,000 high-end GPUs for six months, provided through companies such as Yotta Data Services, Tata Communications, and E2E Networks.

This is a massive vote of confidence from the Indian state. The government is essentially saying: we want our AI stack built here, by Indian engineers, running on Indian infrastructure, governed by Indian law. That has implications for data privacy, national security, and economic self-reliance that go far beyond the technology itself.

AI is becoming core infrastructure, and India needs to build that infrastructure for itself. I could not agree more with that framing.

## Real-World Impact Already Happening

What moves me about Sarvam is that this is not a company sitting on promises. It is already integrated into systems that affect real people.

In March 2025, the Unique Identification Authority of India announced a collaboration with Sarvam AI to integrate AI-based voice interactions and multilingual support into Aadhaar-related services. Aadhaar is the world's largest biometric identity system with over a billion registered users. Bringing multilingual AI voice interaction to Aadhaar services means a person who only speaks Odia or Assamese can now interact with their own government identity infrastructure in their own language. That is not a trivial improvement. That is transformative access.

The company's conversational AI agent platform, Samvaad, has handled over 10 million conversation turns across Indian languages. Ten million. That is not a proof of concept. That is a platform.

## Why This Matters to the World, Not Just India

I want to make a broader argument here because I think it is easy to frame Sarvam as an India story and miss the global significance.

The world is not a monolith. AI systems that only truly understand English and a handful of European languages do not serve the majority of humanity. India's linguistic challenge is an extreme version of a challenge faced by hundreds of millions of people across Southeast Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. The frameworks, the architectures, the training approaches, and the deployment strategies that Sarvam is developing to handle 22 diverse Indian languages are directly applicable to every low-resource language community on the planet.

Sarvam open-sourced Sarvam-Translate and has received considerable positive feedback from the developer community, especially around language quality and usability. The team is looking to improve tokenizer support for very low-resource Indian languages like Manipuri, Santali, and Kashmiri for greater inclusivity. When those improvements happen, they will be learnable by every research team working on low-resource language AI globally.

Sarvam's work is also a proof of concept for what I would call "contextual AI sovereignty": the idea that every major nation and linguistic community deserves AI systems that understand it deeply rather than approximately. The playbook Sarvam is writing in India will be studied and adapted by others around the world.

## The Competitive Landscape and What Makes Sarvam Different

Let me be honest about where Sarvam sits. India has become a key battleground for generative AI adoption. OpenAI's ChatGPT has more than 100 million weekly active users in India, while Anthropic has noted that India accounts for 5.8% of total Claude usage, second only to the US. The global AI giants are not ignoring India.

What Sarvam has that no global player can replicate is native depth. OpenAI can add Hindi support. It cannot build a model whose foundational training, cultural alignment, linguistic intuition, and institutional partnerships are rooted in India the way Sarvam's are. When Sarvam's model handles code-mixed text where someone is naturally blending Hindi and English in the same sentence, it does so with an understanding that comes from being built for exactly that reality, not retrofitted to accommodate it.

That is a defensible, meaningful moat.

## Final Thoughts

I have been watching the Indian tech ecosystem for a while now, and I genuinely believe Sarvam AI represents something qualitatively different from most startups I follow. It is not chasing a market trend. It is building infrastructure for a civilization-scale need.

The combination of deep language research, government backing, enterprise traction, consumer products, and an open-source commitment to the broader developer community makes Sarvam one of the most complete AI companies to emerge from anywhere in the world, not just India, in recent years.

When I think about what it means for a billion-plus people to finally have AI that truly understands them, in their language, in their context, respecting their cultural logic, built on their own soil, I find it hard not to feel that something genuinely important is happening in Bengaluru right now.

Sarvam AI is not just building models. It is building the foundation for an AI-enabled India. And in doing so, it is showing the rest of the world what it looks like when you build AI for everyone, not just for those who already have a voice.
